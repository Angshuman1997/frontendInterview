# What is the Virtual DOM and how does it work

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM. It acts as a layer between React’s rendering logic and the real browser DOM, allowing React to update the UI efficiently without directly manipulating the DOM every time something changes.

How it works:

1. React keeps a copy of the UI in memory as a Virtual DOM tree. Each node in this tree represents an element in the actual DOM.
2. When the application state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree to reflect the updated UI.
3. React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called the reconciliation (diffing) algorithm.
4. It identifies the minimal number of changes between the two trees.
5. React updates only the changed elements in the real DOM (not the entire UI), improving performance.

Example:
If a component changes from:

<h1>Hello</h1>
to
<h1>Hi</h1>

React doesn’t re-render the entire <h1> element. It simply updates the text node from “Hello” to “Hi”.

Why it’s faster:

* Direct DOM manipulation is expensive because it triggers reflows and repaints.
* The Virtual DOM reduces these operations by batching updates and applying only what’s necessary.
* It allows React to render updates in memory first, then efficiently sync with the real DOM.

In simple terms:
Virtual DOM → Compute difference → Apply minimal updates to Real DOM.

Interview-ready answer:
The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM used by React to improve performance. When state or props change, React builds a new Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous one, and updates only the elements that changed in the real DOM. This process, called reconciliation, minimizes costly DOM operations and keeps the UI fast and efficient.
