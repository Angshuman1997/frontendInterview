# Explain React Fiber in simple terms

React Fiber is the internal engine that powers how React renders and updates the user interface. It was introduced in React 16 as a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm to make rendering smoother, faster, and more flexible.

In simple terms, React Fiber allows React to **pause, resume, and prioritize rendering tasks** instead of processing everything at once. This prevents the UI from freezing when large updates or slow components are being rendered.

Before Fiber (React 15 and earlier):
React’s rendering was **synchronous** — once rendering started, React had to finish the entire update before responding to user actions. If rendering took too long, the app could feel slow or unresponsive.

With Fiber (React 16+):
React’s rendering became **asynchronous and incremental**. It breaks rendering work into small chunks (called “fibers”) and spreads them across multiple frames. This allows React to:

* Pause rendering to handle more important tasks like user input.
* Resume rendering later without losing progress.
* Prioritize updates (e.g., user typing > background data fetch).
* Prepare updates in the background for smoother transitions.

Example (real-world analogy):
Think of Fiber as a multitasking system.
Before Fiber: React did one big task at a time — like writing a full essay without stopping.
With Fiber: React can write a paragraph, take a break to answer an important message (user interaction), and then continue writing the essay later — without starting over.

How it works (under the hood):

* React converts each component into a “fiber node” representing a unit of work.
* React walks through these fibers one by one, performing rendering and diffing tasks.
* The process is split into two phases:

  1. **Render (Reconciliation) Phase:** Can be paused, resumed, or aborted.
  2. **Commit Phase:** Applies changes to the real DOM (synchronous and fast).

Key benefits of React Fiber:

* Enables **concurrent rendering** (multiple updates can happen without blocking the UI).
* Allows **update prioritization** (urgent tasks like user input are handled first).
* Makes animations and transitions smoother.
* Provides the foundation for features like **React Suspense** and **Concurrent Mode**.

Interview-ready answer:
React Fiber is React’s new reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It allows React to break rendering work into smaller units that can be paused, resumed, or prioritized. This makes the UI more responsive by preventing long renders from blocking user interactions. Fiber enables concurrent rendering, smoother animations, and better performance for large or complex UIs.
